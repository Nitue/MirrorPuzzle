Example game using Zenject as dependency injection container. The objective is to land correctly colored photons into the photon receivers. Player can change the energy input of photon emitters to affect the created photon and rotate the emitters. Player has to find the correct settings to land a photon in every receiver.

-	Substances absorb a photon and then emit a photon of their respective color of the spectrum.
-	Photons are represented by small spheres.
-	The player may set up the course and then activate it to see what happens. He has a limited number of tries to get it right.
