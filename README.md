# MirrorPuzzle
Dependency Injection example in Unity3D.

## Preview

As suggested on the Slack channel. There are photon emitters and photon receivers. The objective is to land correctly colored photons into the photon receivers at the same time (or within 1 second of each other).
-	Reflectors bounce the photon in an angle
-	Space time valleys curve the trajectory (and typically increase the wavelength)
-	Substances absorb a photon and then emit a photon of their respective color of the spectrum.
-	Photons are represented by small spheres.
-	The player may set up the course and then activate it to see what happens. He has a limited number of tries to get it right.
